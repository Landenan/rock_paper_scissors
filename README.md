# rock_paper_scissors
This is the third project from my "The Odin Project" curriculum, the first one coding JavaScript.

The project comes with a set of steps to take care of.

For a start, I'm creating the repository of the project and stablish the basic structure of the application, 
making an index.html and a script.js files, link them and test if the link is well done. The game will be played 
via console, so, for now, I'll just make the link to the script file in the index.html one.
